- <b>Shape Monster Game</b>
<h4>Introduction</h4>  
The Shape Monster Game is a text-based educational game designed to help children practice reading by collecting shapes in different classrooms while avoiding the Shape Monster. This game was originally created in 2022 during my IT-145 class using Python and has been enhanced to show my skills in 3 categories: Software Engineering, Data Structures and Algorithms, and Databases.

<h4>Features</h4>  

- Language Conversion: The game was converted from Python to C++ to demonstrate proficiency in multiple programming languages.</b>

- Data Structures: Implemented advanced data structures such as hash tables and unordered maps for efficient data handling.
- Object-Oriented Programming: Utilized OOP principles by creating a Game class for better code organization and maintainability.
- CRUD Operations: Integrated a to-do list featuring CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations for managing tasks related to collecting shapes.
- User-Friendly Interface: Enhanced user experience through iterative testing and feedback.

<h4>How to play</h4>  

- Navigate through different classrooms by typing commands (North, South, East, West).

- Collect various shapes (moon, triangle, heart, rectangle, diamond, circle) while avoiding the Shape Monster.
  
- Use the to-do list menu to manage tasks related to collecting shapes.

<h4>Additional Enhancements</h4>

- Random Monster Location: The Shape Monster now appears randomly in different rooms, adding unpredictability.

- Number Guess Range: The number-guessing range was adjusted from 1-10 to 1-3 to make it easier for children.

- Game Class: Added a Game class to apply OOP principles and improve code organization.
